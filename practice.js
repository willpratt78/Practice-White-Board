Prompt 1

URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"

Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"


element = " "
Input.forEach {
 if (element == true)
    element = "%20"
};


prompt 2

Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi" 7, 53]
input2 = Input

Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]

Input.forEach {
    Input2.forEach{
      if input2 == Input
      Input = ""
    }
    return Input
}
